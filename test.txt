Hey guys.
I have a question about flow of project.
When you build your clients AI and you’re using Pinecone and Supabase, do you set up those two with your credentials then migrate or rebuild everything on their accounts once it’s completed?
Or are you charging a monthly fee to keep the client using your accounts?
What are the Pro’s and Cons?
Thanks
