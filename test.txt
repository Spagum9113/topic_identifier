The monthly AI+ML+Robots meet-up is on every second Monday of the month (except July).
Web-site: https://ai-ml-robots.github.io
Meet-up group: https://www.meetup.com/ai-ml-robots
Will be aiming to build upon the LeRobot hack-a-thon momentum and focus on that project for the next few months
Everyone is very welcome to join in … regardless of experience … aiming to lower the barrier to entry.
We met to build (bring a laptop) … also, bring a robot if you have one !
Whilst there is a focus on robotics … a lot of this is applicable to general AI+ML application development.
